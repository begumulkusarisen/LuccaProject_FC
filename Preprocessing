**STEPS ON GETTING THE DYNAMIC FUNCTIONAL MATRICES ON BRAINSTORM**
1) Review → import .set file. 
2) Fix electrodes onto the scalp (edit channel)
3) Compute head model → BEM → lower memory option
Then compute the identity noise covariance
Then compute data covariance, Baseline: 0 to 0 seconds. Then Data 0 to 400 seconds. Click block by block to avoid effects of slow shifts in data
4) Compute source. I did LCVM
5) Compute phase lock value NxN: Use scouts --> Schafer 100 Apply scouts function (mean) BEFORE. 
Hilbert (NOTE: Edit hilbert and delete high gamma) 
Windowed. window length = 5s. Window Overlap = 50%. Estimate & save Across combined.

6) Export file to matlab
